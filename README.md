## TECHNOLOGIES
For this project I created a full stack applciation using SQL, Ruby on Rails, and Ember Framework.

## APPROACH
I decided to design the backend first, and build out back end based on the ERD. The app needed to allow a user CRUD on trips, and attraction table.

Once the backend was set up, I drew and designed the front end layer out. Since ember has more complicated layer than other front end framework, I had spent a lot more time on the preparation.

Making frontend browser using ember had a lot of fun, it saved user a lot of time to write a jax request. However, knowing how each layer and ember database working is complicated and doubtfull.
